If you're in the Netherlands near Nijmegen, [send me an email](mailto:iam@janekozga.nl). I'll hook you up.\n- 150ml leftover kombucha or a sip of vinegar\n\n### Preparation\nDo this the night before or a few hours before you start the fermentation process. If you don't wait  for room temperature, you will kill the microorganisms and that's what it is all about.\n\n1. Cook the water\n2. Add sugar and tea, stir until the sugar is dissolved\n3. Let it cool down to at least 45 degrees celsius\n\n### Fermentation\nThis process can take between about a day and two weeks. The hotter it is, the faster the fermentation process will go. Taste using your straw.\n\n1. Add the leftover kombucha (or a sip of vinegar) to your pan of cooled down tea\n2. Transfer the contents of the pan to your jar while filtering out the tea using the sieve\n3. Add your SCOBY to the jar\n4. Cover the jar with the cloth and keep in place with the rubber band\n\n### Harvesting\n1. Take a sip using the straw. Not sour enough? Keep it in. Too sour? Try again or use as vinegar. When it's perfect continue to step two\n2. Transfer the kombucha from the jar to the bottle\n3. Cool for a day and start drinking it or start the second fermentation process\n\n### Second fermentation (optional)\nThis is where you add fizziness and other flavours. This process can take up to a week. Taste with your straw.\n\n1. Add flavours (optional)\n2. Leave the bottle at room temperature until you like the flavour\n3. Because it's in a closed bottle and carbon dioxide starts to form, you need to let some air out or else your bottle will explode\n4. Cool for a day and enjoy your drink!\n\n### Afterwards\nWhen the fermentation process is done the SCOBY will have grown another SCOBY to itself! Cute.  This is nice because now you either have spare or you can give the SCOBY away to a curious friend.\n\n### Cleaning and separating\n\n1. Clean your hands!\n2. Put your SCOBY on a clean plate\n3. Clean your SCOBY using cold water, the bottom of it probably has some tea residue\n4. Try to separate the SCOBYs\n5. Add your SCOBY back in the kombucha or make a new batch\n\n### Saving your SCOBY\nSaving your SCOBY in the fridge can keep up to two months.\n\n1. Put the SCOBY in a jar with water and a cloth on top\n2. Cool the jar in the fridge, this will slow down the fermentation process\n\n### Tips\n- Note what date you started fermenting for each batch \n- For more background information on fermenting and kombucha check out [The Art of Fermentation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13598307-the-art-of-fermentation) by Sandor Ellix Katz or [Noma Guide to Fermentation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37590384-foundations-of-flavor?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_17) by Ren\xe9 Redzepi and David Zilber",title:"Kombucha recipe",socialImage:"images/klara-avsenik-5cFqO92t7pM-unsplash.jpg",tags:["fermenting"],metaDesc:"Kombucha is a fermented drink made from tea which has become very popular over the last few years.

This one is going to short and sweet. Enjoy.\n\n## Prerequisites\nYou can use this on any Javascript project.\n\n## Find a font\nGo to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and find a font you like. Or even better use the [Fontsource search tool](https://fontsource.org/fonts) to find all the fonts they have available, which is much more than only Google Fonts.\n\n## Installation\nInstall the [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/docs/introduction) package for your specific font:\n\n```bash \nnpm install @fontsource/open-sans --save\n```\n\n## Usage\nNow use the `@fontsource` package in your `app.js` file and every time that you will start your Next.js app, it will use the cached fonts.\n\n```js \n// app.js\n\n// either import the whole thing.\nimport "@fontsource/open-sans/";\n\n// or import just the font styles you need.\nimport "@fontsource/open-sans/400.css";\n```\n\nAfterwards actually use the font in your CSS.\n```css\n/* app.css */\nbody { font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; }\n```\n\n## Why?\nBack in the day CDNs for fonts were all the rage. So why wouldn\'t we keep on doing that?\nThe people from Fontsource explain self hosting really well:\n\n- Self-hosting brings **significant performance gains** as loading fonts from hosted services, such as Google Fonts, lead to an extra (render blocking) network request. To provide perspective, for simple websites it has been seen to _double_ visual load times.\n  Benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/pull/607) and [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/reactiflux.com/pull/21).\n- Fonts remain **version locked**. Google often pushes updates to their fonts [without notice](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/1307), which may interfere with your live production projects. Manage your fonts like any other NPM dependency.\n- Commit to **privacy**. Google does track the usage of their fonts and for those who are extremely privacy concerned, self-hosting is an alternative.\n- Your **fonts load offline**. On top of benefiting PWAs, often there may be situations, like working in an airplane or train, leaving you stranded without access to your online hosted fonts. Have the ability to keep working under any circumstance.\n\n## Icons\nAs an extra tip! In the same style as Fontsource (monorepo open source assets), there\'s also a similar solution for icons called [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) which is worth checking out.\nVue developers can check out [oh-vue-icons](https://oh-vue-icons.js.org/), Svelte devs can use [svelte-icons-pack](https://github.com/leshak/svelte-icons-pack) but I haven\'t found any solution for Angular yet.
