Invert all colors, set a nice background, and invert again images and emojis so correct.\n\n## Prerequisites\nYou can use this on any frontend website on [almost all browsers](https://caniuse.com/prefers-color-scheme) (97% of all users while writing this).\n\n## Implementing Dark Mode\n\nDark mode usually requires considerable effort and needs to be implemented consistently across all future components. \n**However**, I found a dead easy way to implement it in less than one minute.\nLet's see some code!\n\n```css\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n    body {\n        filter: invert(100%);\n        background-color: black;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis works almost perfectly out of the box! However, there are some issues with some elements on the page!\n\nImages and emojis are also inverted, but they should appear in their original colors. To achieve this, we can apply a double inversion to return them to their normal appearance. Makes sense?\n\n```css\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n    img, .emoji {\n        filter: invert(100%);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThat's it! The whole page is now ready for dark mode.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHere's how I implemented dark mode on this website:\n\n1. **Invert all colors** across the site.\n2. **Apply a visually pleasing dark background**.\n3. **Adjust images and emojis** by inverting them back to their original colors, ensuring they display correctly.\n\nThis approach helped create a simple, seamless dark mode experience that maintains readability and preserves the intended look of images and emojis.\n\n```css\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n    body {\n        filter: invert(100%);\n        background-color: black;\n    }\n\n    img, .emoji {\n        filter: invert(100%);\n    }\n}\n```\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
