This is how you do it.\nFYI, this works with vegan or dairy milk in exactly the same way.\n\n## Equipment\nFor basically, all the equipment that touches yoghurt makes sure it's stainless steel or glass that's clean and without soap rests. We only want the good bacteria to grow! You can cook it in hot water or clean it properly with soap.\n\n- Pan (you want a pan with a lid that stays warm long. I use cast iron for this reason)\n- Spoon\n- Funnel\n- Litre jar\n- Thermometer  \n- Oven or another warm space\n\n### Ingredients (for 1 litre)\n- 1l of (vegan) milk\n- 4 spoons of (vegan) yoghurt\n\n## The recipe\nThis is why you're here! If you have any feedback or questions, just holler!\n\n1. Turn on the oven (to max 45 degrees Celsius)\n2. Put all the ingredients in the pan \n3. Put pan on stove and heat while stirring to about 40 degrees Celsius\n4. Move the pan from the stove to the oven (or another warm place)\n5. Wait for about 10 hours\n6. Add the yoghurt to a jar (I like like to reuse glass apple juice jars)\n7. That's it! Enjoy!\n\n### Tips\n- With the yoghurt you just made you can make a new batch in a few days! \n- Sometimes the yoghurt culture is just not good enough or something other variable is incorrect (too hot/cold etc). Just try again with another yoghurt/milk. Experimentation is key!\n- You can also buy yoghurt starter culture online, but I've personally never had the need to \n"},"__N_SSG":true}
