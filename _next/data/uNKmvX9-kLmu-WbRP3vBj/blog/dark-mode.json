However, there are some issues with some elements on the page!\n\n\n![Screenshot of the issue](/blog/dark-mode-bug.png)\n\n\nImages, code, and emojis are also inverted, but they should appear in their original colors. To achieve this, we can apply a double inversion to return them to their normal appearance. Makes sense?\n\n```css\nimg, .emoji, pre {\n    filter: invert(100%);\n}\n```\n\nThat's it! The whole page is now ready for dark mode.\n\n![Screenshot of the fix](/blog/dark-mode-fixed.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHere's how I implemented dark mode on this website:\n\n1. **Invert all colors** across the site.\n2. **Apply a visually pleasing dark background**.\n3. **Adjust images, code previews, and emojis** by inverting them back to their original colors, ensuring they display correctly.\n\nThis approach helped create a simple, seamless dark mode experience that maintains readability and preserves the intended look of images and emojis.\n\n```css\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n    body {\n        filter: invert(100%);\n        background-color: black;\n    }\n\n    img, .emoji, pre {\n        filter: invert(100%);\n    }\n}\n```\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
